        <p><b>Lyrics</b></p>
        <p>Baby<br>
            I just want to see you smile<br>
            Just one more time before I leave<br>
            I just want your love and company<br><br>
            'Cause anytime I'm on the road<br>
            You feeling up, you're all alone<br>
            You tell me what you wanna hear<br>
            I'm tryna tell you what I know<br>
            'Cause I just wanna be the peace of your mind<br>
            Anytime that I walk by, but, baby<br><br>
            Baby, why can't you love me?<br>
            Hold me so close, maybe we can be lucky<br>
            I'm calling your name, I'm screaming it out, just love me<br>
            I know that it's hard for you to love me<br>
            Calling your name, I'm screaming it out<br>
            Tell me if you can figure it all out<br>
            And I don't wanna be that guy, but<br>
            I just wanna be your guy<br>
            I just wanna be your man that holds you close<br>
            And looks you right up in your eyes<br>
            And now I'm sweating up in tears 'cause<br>
            You and I are right here, babe<br>
            Tell me what I gotta hear 'cause<br><br>
            All that you wanted<br>
            Gave you, I'm running now<br>
            Running right back to you<br><br>
            Baby, why can't you love me?<br>
            Hold me so close, maybe we can be lucky<br>
            I'm calling your name, I'm screaming it out, just love me<br>
            I know that it's hard for you to love me<br><br>
            Love me<br>
            Hold me so close, maybe we can be lucky<br>
            Love me<br>
            Ohh, love me<br>
            Ohhh, ohh<br>
            La-la-la, love me<br>
            Love<br>
            Love me<br>
            Love, mmh</p>
