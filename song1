        <p><b>Lyrics</b></p>
        <p>You're that goddess<br>
            Aphrodite<br>
            Well known for her love and beauty<br>
            You took me and you bathe me in<br>
            Your waters, your fountain<br>
            Left me yearning for more, for more<br>
            And I can't take it anymore<br><br>
            If I can have this dance tonight<br>
            I promise that you won't forget<br>
            I've been searching all my life<br>
            For something that I won't regret<br>
            Could it be that you're the one I'm looking for?<br>
            Aha<br><br>
            Let me tell you one thing for sure<br>
            You're the only one I want more of<br>
            'Cause every time you strip away my pride<br>
            Humble me down to my knees<br>
            You're exactly what I need, you're exactly<br><br>
            If I can have this dance tonight<br>
            I promise that you won't forget<br>
            I've been searching all my life<br>
            For something that I won't regret<br>
            Could it be that you're the one I'm looking for?<br>
            Aha<br><br>
            Why won't you take me away?<br>
            Bring me to your sacred place<br>
            Won't you ooh<br><br>
            If I can have this dance tonight<br>
            I promise that you won't forget<br>
            I've been searching all my life<br>
            For something that I won't regret<br>
            Could it be that you're the one I'm looking for?Aphrodite
            Aha</p>
