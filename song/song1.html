        <p>IF by:Bread</p>
        <p><b>Lyrics</b></p>
            <p>If a picture paints a thousand words <br>
            Then why can't I paint you? <br>
            The words will never show the you I've come to know <br>
            If a face could launch a thousand ships <br>
            Then where am I to go? <br>
            There's no one home but you <br>
            You're all that's left me to <br>
            And when my love for life is running dry <br>
            You come and pour yourself on me <br><br>
            If a man could be two places at one time <br>
            I'd be with you <br>
            Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way <br>
            If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die <br>
            I'd spend the end with you <br>
            And when the world was through <br>
            Then one by one the stars would all go out <br>
            Then you and I would simply fly away</p>
    </body>
