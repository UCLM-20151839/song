        <p>New West</p>
        <p><b>Lyrics</b></p>
        <p>When we're out in a crowd<br>
            Laughing loud and nobody knows why<br>
            When we're lost at a club, getting drunk<br>
            And you give me that smile<br>
            Going home in the back of a car<br>
            And you hand touches mine<br>
            When we're done making love<br>
            And you look up and give me those eyes<br>
            'Cause all of the small things that you do<br>
            Are what remind me why I fell for you<br>
            And when we're apart, and I'm missing you<br>
            I close my eyes and all I see is you<br>
            And the small things you do<br><br>
            When you call me at night<br>
            While you're out getting high with your friends<br>
            Every "hi", every "bye", every "I love you" you've ever said<br><br>
            'Cause all of the small things that you do<br>
            Are what remind me why I fell for you<br>
            And when we're apart, and I'm missing you<br>
            I close my eyes and all I see is you<br>
            And the small things you do<br><br>
            When we're done making love<br>
            And you look up and give me those eyes<br><br>
            'Cause all of the small things that you do<br>
            Are what remind me why I fell for you<br>
            And when we're apart, and I'm missing you<br>
            I close my eyes and all I see is you<br>
            And all i see is you<br>
            And the small things you do<br>
            All the small things you do</p>
